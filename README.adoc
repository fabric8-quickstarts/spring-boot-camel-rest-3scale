= Spring Boot Camel REST 3scale QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to use Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API and expose it to 3scale.

This example relies on the https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin[Openshift Maven plugin] for its build configuration
and uses the https://github.com/fabric8io/base-images#java-base-images[fabric8 Java base image].

The Openshift Maven Plugin discovers service metadata from Camel XML Context's service definition and exposes the following:

=== Service Label
* `discovery.3scale.net`: Allows 3scale to select Services that are to be automatically exposed.

=== Service Annotations
* `discovery.3scale.net/discovery-version`: the version of the 3scale discovery process.
* `discovery.3scale.net/scheme`: this can be http or https
* `discovery.3scale.net/path`: (optional) the contextPath of the service if it's not at the root.
* `discovery.3scale.net/description-path`: (optional) the path to the service description document (OpenAPI/Swagger). The path is either relative or an external full URL.

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.

IMPORTANT: This quickstart can run in 2 modes: standalone on your machine and on Kubernetes / OpenShift Cluster. Quickstart requires Java 8 or Java 11 (`fuse-java-openshift-jdk11-rhel8` image is used to build in Java 11).

== Deployment options

You can run this quickstart in the following modes:

* Kubernetes / Single-node OpenShift cluster
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to run this quickstart is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this quickstart on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on Container Development Kit 3.3 or OpenShift 3.7.
Both of these products have suitable Fuse images pre-installed.
If you run it in an environment where those images are not preinstalled follow the steps described in <<single-node-without-preinstalled-images>>.

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale`) :
+
or
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/pods/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the log from Camel.

=== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.


. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Configure Red Hat Container Registry authentication (if it is not configured).
Follow https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.13/html-single/fuse_on_openshift_guide/index#configure-container-registry[documentation].

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image fuse-java-openshift:1.13 --from=registry.redhat.io/fuse7/fuse-java-openshift:1.13 --confirm
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale`) :
+
or
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift  -Djkube.generator.fromMode=istag -Djkube.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/fuse-java-openshift:1.13
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/pods/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the log from Camel.

== Accessing the REST service

When the example is running, a REST service is available to list users that have called this service. The user information comes from 3scale extensions to autofill API keys.

* `"x-data-threescale-name": "app_ids"` for the parameter that represents the application ID.
* `"x-data-threescale-name": "app_keys"` or `"x-data-threescale-name": "user_keys"` for the parameter that represents the application or user key.

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you.

The actual endpoint is using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-3scale/users` and the REST service provides two services:

- `users/greet`: to use 3scale API keys to add a user to this service's list of calling users
- `users/list`: to list all users that have called the service

You can then access these services from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-3scale/users/greet>
- <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-3scale/users/list>

== Swagger API

The example provides API documentation of the service using Swagger using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-3scale/api-doc`. You can access the API documentation from your Web browser at <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-3scale/api-doc>.

== Running the quickstart standalone on your machine

To run this quickstart as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.
. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the service:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
Alternatively, you can run the application locally using the executable JAR produced:
+
----
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev target/spring-boot-camel-rest-3scale-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. You can then access the REST API directly from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-3scale/users/greet>
- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-3scale/users/list>
